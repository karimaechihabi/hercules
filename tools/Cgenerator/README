You can compile with make (you need the GNU scientific library)

RUN
----
Before running the generator do this to create random sets at each run 
export GSL_RNG_SEED=$RANDOM

./generator --size 1 --length 256 --z-normalize --filename "/home/karima/sdb1_mount/data/test.bin"

--size is how many time series you want

--length is the length of each time series

--z-normalize is a binary flag that specifies that we want them z-normalized

--filename is the name of the file to store the data in binary format

the dataset should be named using the convention:
data_fulldatasize_datasetname_dataserieslength (add _znorm if data is znormalized or _nznorm otherwise) 
if the data is synthetic, the datasetname is the seed.

The queries filename should be named following the same convention as the dataset,
for instance queries_queriessize_queriesname_dataserieslength  (add _znorm if queries are znormalized or _nznorm otherwise) 
if the queries are synthetic, the queriesname is the seed.
