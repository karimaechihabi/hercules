- buffer-size    The total size of RAM in MBs to use by the algorithm (should be less than 80% of total RAM)
- epsilon        The distance approximation error. Set epsilon = 0 for exact search.
- dataset        The full path to the file containing the data to be indexed
- delta          The probability that epsilon is not exceeded. Set delta = 1 for exact and deterministic search. 
- queries-size   The number of queries
- track-bsf      The default is 0. Set to 1 to track the intermediate answers 
- incremental    The default is 0. Set to 1 for incremental search.
- track-pruning  The default is 0. Set to 1 to track the pruning during search.
- all-mindists   The default is 0. Set to 1 to track all the lower-bounding distances.
- k              The number of neighbors to retrieve during k-NN search.
- leaf-size      The maximum number of data objects to store in one leaf.
- max-policy     The default is 0. Set to 1 to sort the pqueue during search in descending value of LB. The default is ascending order.
- dataset-hists  The file containing the data distribution information needed for delta-epsilon search where delta <1.
- nprobes        The maximum number of leaves to search during ng-approximate search.
- index-path     The full path to the index files.
- queries        The full path to the binary file containing the queries.
- serial         The default is 1. Set to 1 to build one file containing all the leaves data.
- minimum-distance  The minimum distance for range search
- timeseries-size   The length of the data series
- sax-cardinality   Only set to change the default cardinality for the SAX summarization
- paa-segments      Only set to change the number of segments to use for the SAX summarization
- num-queues        The number of queues to use in parallel search
- num-threads       The number of threads to use during index building or query answering
- num-read-threads  The number of read threads for oversubcription during query answering (total threads = num-threads * num-read-threads). 
- approx-stop-condition  The number of leaves to visit during approximate search.
- mode              0 for indexing,1 for query answering and 2 for both
- dataset-size      The number of candidate data objects 
- sims              Set to use skip-sequential search during query answering
- queries-skip      The number of queries to skip
- flush-threshold   The number of threads that should have a full buffer before the flush coordinator issues the order to flush
- num-write-threads The number of threads to use during index writing 
- eapca-threshold   The EAPCA pruning threshold. 
- sax-threshold     The SAX pruning threshold
- initial-db-size   The size of the double buffer in terms of the number of data series
